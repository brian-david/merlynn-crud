# Merlynn Assessment

## Description

This project is a Next.js 15 application that uses app routing and server actions along with Tailwind CSS. It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The application provides users with various functionalities to interact with the TOM API and store relevant data.

## Features

- Pull metadata from the TOM API for the "Drink choice" model and display the model name and input variables in a form for the user to complete. This should hit the v3/models or v3/models/[id] endpoints.

- Query the model with the userâ€™s input and display the decision on the screen. This should hit the v3/decision/[id] endpoint.

- Store data and decisions gathered from the TOM API.
