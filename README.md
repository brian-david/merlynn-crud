Merlynn Assessment

Description

This project is a Next.js 15 application that uses app routing and server actions along with Tailwind CSS. It connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The application provides users with various functionalities to interact with the TOM API and store relevant data.

Features

Pull metadata from the TOM API for the "Drink choice" model and display the model name and input variables in a form for the user to complete. This should hit the v3/models or v3/models/[id] endpoints.

Query the model with the userâ€™s input and display the decision on the screen. This should hit the v3/decision/[id] endpoint.

Store data and decisions gathered from the TOM API.

Implement security considerations.

Add batch functionality of the TOM API.

Allow the user to pick any model from the TOM API.
